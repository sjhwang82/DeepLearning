# Deep Learning @ KAIST

## Course Information

**Description**

This course covers various models and algorithms for deep learning, including both the fundemantal concepts and recent advances. In the first half of the course, we will learn about the most basic topics such as multi-layer preceptrons, backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, Transformers, autoencoders and variational autoencoders, optimization and regularization of deep learning models. We will also have multiple lab sessions in which the TAs demonstrate how to perform training and inference learned models at the code level. Then, in the second half of the course, we will go over more advanced models, such as generative adversarial networks, efficient CNN architectures, self-supervised learning and pretrained language models, and graph neural networks, while working on a project that aims to solve a real-world problem utilizing one of them.

### Grading Policy
* **Absolute Grading** - You will be graded by the total absolute score, and not the relative ranking. Every project groups will be also graded solely based on the absolute quality of the final project outcome, not in comparison to others.
* Mid-term Exam: 20% - The exam will cover the basic topics of deep learning taught in the first half of the course.
* Final Exam: 20% - This will cover the advanced topics taught in the second half of the course. 
* Programming Assignments: 30% - You will work on two to three programming assignments and submit the code as well as the report.
* Attendance and Participation: 20% - Active participation during or off-class hours will be highly appreciated.
